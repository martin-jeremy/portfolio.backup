  summary: "Mast cells (MCs) are tissue-resident immune cells which could be identified as Conjonctive Tissue Mast cells (CTMCs) and Mucosal Mast cells (MMCs). Thank's to single cell RNA seq approach, we reached to establish transcriptomics profiles of these Mast cells, understanding their functions and tissue-imprintings, with the aim to develop a transcriptomic atlas across organs."

  summary: "Invited to speak at the Scientific Day organized by Genotoul about heterogeneity in single cell RNA seq data. Presentation about the impact of heterogeneity of scRNA-seq data in a classical analysis pipeline and the importance of taking it into account. Throughout this presentation, I used three different types of datasets, generated by the team, to support my points."
